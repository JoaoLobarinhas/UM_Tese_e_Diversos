This repository contains code to compute vulnerability to fake news spreading for 
nodes and communities of a social network.

Dataset of twitter source tweeter and retweeters (proxy of spreaders) and their 
corresponding follower/following (proxy for spreaders) is provided.

Communities can be created using popular community detection algorithms.
